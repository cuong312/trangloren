== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I show in the popups? =
You can add contents to the editor box as you do for wordpress posts or pages and that content will be shown in the popups. You can style thme as you like using CSS and appropriate HTML elements inside your content.

= Can I add shortcodes in the content? =
Yes, you can use shortcodes as you do in your blog posts or pages. Any shortcode that is working for blog posts and pages should also work in the popup.

= Mailchimp embeded forms do not show any responses after submit in the popup? =
Yes, they do. But you need to add and save the embed code in the Text mode of the editor, not Visual mode. If you add code in the text mode and switch to visual mode then Wordpress will automatically remove some empty divs styled as "display:none" and the stylesheet links. So just make sure you add codes in the text mode of the editor and it will work fine.
